# Demo web service - counter

## Starting instructions

Service can be started with following commands. Idea is to run scripts from project's `<root_directory>`

```
git clone https://github.com/m-drozdzinski/webservice-counter.git
cd webservice-counter
./run-service.sh
```

## Manual testing

There are some examples how to interact with service in directory:  `/manual_tests`

## Api documentation

Api can be found in `documentation` directory. If you followed [starting instruction](#starting-instruction) you should be able to open swagger ui with `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

You may need to install doker for this project. Please follow installation instructions [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
